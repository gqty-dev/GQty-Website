  started, don't care about the details here. Skip to [read](/react/read) and
  start playing around!

This page is written mainly for power users, or those who want to maintain
multiple client configurations in one project. Read on if one of the following
conditionss hits:

1. You have multiple GraphQL endpoints in one project and federation is not an option.
1. You are a user of GQty v2 and want to progressively migrate.
1. You are doing codegen with customizations not yet supported by us.
1. You are REALLY curious.

## The React Client

The React client is a wrapper that builds on top of the [core](/core), adding
React hooks and hooks related internal mechanism for some hooks such as query
batching and global cache subscribers.

This page assumes you already have a core client and a generated schema, if you
don't already have a core client, head over to the [core](/core) landing page
and create one.

The most simply way to create a new React client,

```ts
import { createReactClient } from "@gqty/react";

// Assuming you already have the core client created here.
import { client, GeneratedSchema } from "./gqty/core";

export const { useQuery, useMutation, useSubscription } =
  createReactClient<GeneratedSchema>(client);
```
