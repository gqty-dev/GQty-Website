# Concepts

<Alert className="mt-3" title="Intended Level: Intermediate">
  This section explains some thought process and design concepts behind GQty. It
  assumes a certain degree of knowledge across multiple domains, such as the
  experience using other GraphQL clients, Web standards and cache management in
  JavaScript.
</Alert>

## A cache that fetches

The core concept behind GQty is simple, you interact with the cache while it
automatically fetches missing data on-the-fly.

### Scoped Queries

While it is handy for a centralized group of cache accessors that groups all
selections and fetches as much as possible in one go, there are use cases where
separation is necessary.

It is especially important when implementing persisted queries and operation
names. Selections under these context cannot be mixed up with other queries
under a different one.

Scoped contexts contain the following elements, which may affect how Selections
are combined and ultimately fetched.

1. Operation Name
1. Cache Policy
1. Suspense

Suspense is the most important consideration point if you have Suspense enabled.
It determines which level and how many levels in the component tree a query may
be suspended and fetched, it also decides the error boundaries of your app.

### Selection Batching

When making selections by interacting with the cache, GQty captures what is
being accessed, combine selections with the same context, fetching them with as
few requests as possible.

<Alert className="mt-5" title="Pass query objects as props">
  In React, the `useQuery()` hook creates a new scoped context for each
  component. Scoped contexts split up selections which sometimes may not be what
  you wanted. Instead, you should pass query objects down the component tree as
  if their data already fetched. This allows selections to be grouped into one
  single request.
</Alert>

## All queries are live queries

In React, components create live subscriptions to the current cache even without
GraphQL Subscriptions involved. This allows most of the normalization magic
happens when a seemingly unrelated changes or fetch from other components
arrives, all components reaching such objects will also be updated.

## Refetching

### Soft Refetch

Refetching in GQty does not necessarily means a network request. A refetch first
checks the cache freshness of accessed data, it fetches only on cache miss AND
the current cache policy allows it.

Consider soft refetches a cache validity check instead, this allows more
frequent refetching strategies. Our `useQuery()` hook has options for automatic
refetches on window focus, network reconnect and even periodic attempts.

### Hard Refetch

Users may specify `no-cache` or `no-store` as the cache policy in core, or
simply use `query.$refetch(true)` in React to bypass a fresh cache and forces a
network request.

## Cache Policy

When designing an expiring cache with stale-while-revalidate (SWR) support,
there is an important concept inherited from the Web standards:
[`Request.cache`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request/cache).

`Request.cache` is the strategy dealing with the current cache, before fetching
remote endpoints.

GraphQL servers usually do not hint about cache lifetime for the data, so it is
up to developers who make correct assumptions on each and every one of their own
projects.

| Value                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| :---------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `default`                     | Serves the cached contents when it is fresh, and if they are stale within the stale-while-revalidate (SWR) window, fetches in the background and updates the cache. Always fetches on stale cache or cache miss. <br /><br /> During SWR, a successful fetch will not notify cache updates. New contents are served on next query. |
| `reload`                      | Always fetch, updates client cache on response.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `no-cache`                    | Same as `reload`, for GraphQL does not support conditional requests.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `no-store`                    | Always fetch and does not update on response. <br /><br /> GQty creates a temporary cache at query-level which immediately expires.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| <nobr>`force-cache`</nobr>    | Serves the cached contents regardless of staleness. It fetches on cache miss or a stale cache, updates the cache on response.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| <nobr>`only-if-cached`</nobr> | Serves the cached contents regardless of staleness, throws a network error on cache miss.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

<Alert title="Cache Policy is not Fetch Policy">
  Our React package has the option `fetchPolicy` which is heavily inspired by
  the Apollo Client. But over time, we found the cache option in the Fetch API
  more concise and easier to understand across multiple APIs.

## Cache Normalization

Cache normalization is best explained with sketches.

Given two data trees in cache, both containing node "a".

<Image
  className="dark:hidden"
  src={svgNormalization1}
  alt="fig1: Cache Normalization Step 1"
/>
<Image
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src={svgNormalization1Dark}
  alt="fig1: Cache Normalization Step 1"
/>

They will be merged into the same object reference, and kept in a global store.

<Image
  className="dark:hidden"
  src={svgNormalization2}
  alt="fig2: Cache Normalization Step 2"
/>
<Image
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src={svgNormalization2Dark}
  alt="fig2: Cache Normalization Step 2"
/>

This global store will be serialized along with the main data cache during
persistence and rehydration.

### Normalized, still Reactive.

When a node is part of an updating tree, subscribers of other trees referencing
the same node will also be notified.

<Image
  className="dark:hidden"
  src={svgNormalization3}
  alt="fig3: Cache Normalization Step 3"
/>
<Image
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src={svgNormalization3Dark}
  alt="fig3: Cache Normalization Step 3"
/>

### Stable Object References

Otherwise maintaining a reverse lookup map, normalized object references inside
query caches will be a proxy of the actual data inside the global store.

When objects are updated or replaced, references to the proxies won't change
only underlying objects are swapped.

<Image
  className="dark:hidden"
  src={svgNormalization4}
  alt="fig4: Cache Normalization Step 4"
/>
<Image
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src={svgNormalization4Dark}
  alt="fig4: Cache Normalization Step 4"
/>
