    > npx @gqty/cli [options] [endpoint...]
    ```

  <Tab>

    ```bash copy
    > yarn dlx @gqty/cli [options] [endpoint...]
    ```

  <Tab>

    ```bash copy
    > pnpm dlx @gqty/cli [options] [endpoint...]
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Options

### `-H`, `--header`

Add custom header during introspection, useful when your endpoint requires
authentication.

```bash copy
> npx @gqty/cli -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

### `--react`

Forces React client generation regardless if you are using it.

Defaults to `true` if `react` is found in the dependencies in your
`package.json`, `false` otherwise.

### `--subscriptions`

Initialize a subscription client during code generation.

You may also specify `--subscriptions=graphql-sse` if your GraphQL server uses
Server Side Events for subscriptions.

Defaults to `graphql-ws` if subscriptions are found during introspection,
otherwise subscription client will be skipped.

### `--target`

Target path for the generated client.

Client generation will be skipped if target file already exists. To regenerate
the client, delete your existing one or specify a new target.

You may specify a value as the path target for the generated client, e.g.
`--target=gqty/client.generated.ts`.

A schema file `schema.generated.ts` will also be generated in the same
directory, running this command will always regenerate this schema file.

Defaults to `gqty/index.ts`.

### `--typescript`

Forces a TypeScript client to be generated over a JavaScript one.

Defaults to `true` if `typescript` is found in the dependencies in your
`package.json`.

### `-w`, `--watch`

Watches for changes in specified endpoints, regenerates the schema when changes
are detected.

URL endpoints will be polled with a dynamic interval derived as a running
average of the last few regeneration, this prevents hanging up the machine when
working with huge schemas.
