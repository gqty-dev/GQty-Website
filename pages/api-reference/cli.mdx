1. You are curious
1. We missed something in the interactive setup [seriously, let us know!](https://github.com/gqty-dev/gqty/issues/new)
1. You are a devOp or a sysadmin

</Alert>

## Basic Usage

<Tabs items={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
  <Tab>

    ```bash copy
    > npx @gqty/cli [options] <endpoint>
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab>

    ```bash copy
    > yarn dlx @gqty/cli [options] <endpoint>
    ```

  </Tab>

  <Tab>

    ```bash copy
    > pnpm dlx @gqty/cli [options] <endpoint>
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### TODO

1. Explain the arguments
   1. All arguments will be treated as endpoints.
   1. Endpoints can be URLs or path to a file.
1. With arguments and/or options
   1. When called with one or more argument, URLs are fetched, files are read. The
      results will be merged with schema stitching.
   1. Client will be generated, otherwise an error is thrown.
      1. Fallback to interactive mode when
         1. stdin is a TTY
         1. Introspection fails with 401 or 403
1. Interactive (Without arguments)
   1. Introspection starts right after endpoint question is answered,
      next question depends on this result.
   1. When introspection fails with HTTP 401, ask for authentication method,
      then retry the step above.
   1. On other errors, ask if user wants to start over or exit.

## Interactive Setup

## Options

### `-H`, `--header`

Add custom header during introspection, useful when your endpoint requires authentication.

```bash copy
> npx @gqty/cli -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

### `--react`

Forces React client generation regardless if you are using it.

Defaults to `true` if `react` is found in the dependencis in your `package.json`,
`false` otherwise.

### `--subscriptions`

Initialize a subscription client during code generation.

You may also specify `--subscriptions=graphql-sse` if your GraphQL server uses
Server Side Events for subscriptions.

Defaults to `graphql-ws` if subscriptions are found during introspection,
otherwise subscription client will be skipped.

### `--target`

Target path for the generated client.

Client generation will be skipped if target file already exists. To regenerate
the client, delete your existing one or specify a new target.

You may specify a value as the path target for the generated client, e.g.
`--target=gqty/client.generated.ts`.

A schema file `schema.generated.ts` will also be generated in the same
directory, running this command will always regenerate this schema file.

Defaults to `gqty/index.ts`.

### `--typescript`

Forces a TypeScript client to be generated over a JavaScript one.

Defaults to `true` if `typescript` is found in the dependencis in your
`package.json`.

### `-w`, `--watch`

Watches for changes in specified endpoints, regenerates the schema when changes
are detected.

URL endpoints will be polled with a dynamic interval derived as a running
average of the last few regeneration, this prevents hanging up the machine when
working with huge schemas.

You may override the polling interval by specifying a time unit comptiable with
`ms` as the option value, e.g. `--watch="1 minute"` or `-w5s`. This interval is
ignored when watching local files.
