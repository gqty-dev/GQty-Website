# React Server Components (RSC)

Server Components are asynchronous components that renders on the server,
sending only the generated mark ups to client side with potentially zero
JavaScript.

With RSC, data fetching from protected backends no longer requires a separate
API methods that builds only for such purpose. Instead it is fetched right at
the backend, where you don't have to worry about leaking of backend
authentication keys.

Fetching data from the edge, right where your data is located, may also reduce
overall latency and safes at least one multi-hop fetch from the client side.

```tsx filename="app/profile/page.tsx"
import { GQtyError, resolve } from "../gqty";
import { type User } from "../gqty/schema.generated";
import Profile from "./Profile";

export const prepare = ({
  firstName,
  middleNames,
  lastName,
  image: { alt, src },
  lastLogin,
  birthday,
  friends,
}: User) => {
  friends({ first: 10 }).map(
    ({ firstName, lastName, image: { alt, src } }) => {}
  );
};

export default async function ProfilePage() {
  const { data, errors } = await resolve(({ query: { me } }) => {
    prepare(me);
  });

  // Error boundaries
  if (errors) {
    throw GQtyError.fromGraphQLErrors(errors);
  }

  return <Profile user={data?.me} />;
}
```

We recommend always exporting your selection function, read more about this
in [Querying with Suspense](/guides/react/read#suspense);

<Alert className="mt-5" title="Avoid hooks on Server Components">
  Hooks and Server Components do not play well together. Until there is a way
  for a seamless implementation for both, we recommend sticking with GQty core
  at the moment.
