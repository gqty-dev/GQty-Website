# `resolve()` - The Promise Interface

In GQty core, the `resolve()` method gives you a promise interface to work with
GraphQL queries, it allows the usage of Query, Mutation and Subscription.

A simple example route `/profile` for SvelteKit would look like this.

```js filename="src/routes/profile/+page.js"
import { resolve } from "$lib/gqty";

/** @type {import('./$types').PageLoad} */
export async function load({ params }) {
  const { data } = await resolve(
    ({
      query: {
        me: {
          firstName,
          lastName,
          email,
          image: { src, alt },
        },
      },
    }) => {}
  );

  return {
    user: data?.me,
  };
}
```

<Alert title="Subscriptions">
  The resolve function wraps GraphQL subscriptions into a promise-like
  interface. Subscriptions created via `resolve()` will be closed upon first
  data receival (the first `next` message).
