# React Server Components (RSC)

Server Components are asynchronous components that renders on the server,
sending only the generated mark ups to client side with potentially zero
JavaScript.

With RSC, data fetching from protected backends no longer requires a separate
API methods that builds only for such purpose. Instead it is fetched right at
the backend, where you don't have to worry about leaking of backend
authentication keys.

Fetching data from the edge, right where your data is located, may also reduce
overall latency and safes at least one multi-hop fetch from the client side.
