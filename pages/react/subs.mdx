# Subscriptions

The basic usage of subscriptions are as easy as queries.

```tsx filename="src/notifications.tsx"
import { useSubscription } from "../gqty";

export default function Notifications() {
  const { notification } = useSubscription();

  return (
    <>
      <p>{notification.message}</p>
      <div>
        Received at: {new Date(notification.createdAt).toLocaleString()}
      </div>
    </>
  );
}
```

This creates a long-lived subscription to your endpoint and continues to receive
backend updates as they happen.

With normalized cache enabled in GQty, object updates received from
subscriptions are automatically populated to components watching the same
object via queries.

There are two ways to design your subscriptions, having each of them with its
own benefits and drawbacks. You should be concise about each and choose the one
best fits your application.

## Event based Subscriptions (Event Streams)

Subscriptions may represent a stream of events happening on server side,
sending a replayable history to the client. This enables interesting use cases
of live collaborations and other real-time interactions.

Event based subscriptions are best suited to trigger further actions, such as
fetching related updates for currently visible components when an event is
received. Event payloads should stay small.

<Alert
  className="mt-5"
  severity="warning"
  title="Busy connections may stall the UI."

  It is easy to think of Subscriptions as easy data streams. But without
  backpressure and buffering support, servers have no inherent knowledge about
  the client state. If subscriptions are hooked to high traffic backend streams,
  client UI may become unresponsive at best, sometimes even losing messages
  mid-flight due to WebSockets timing out.

## Entity based Subscriptions (Live Queries)

One of the drawbacks that event-based subscriptions may introduce is the
lack of ways to recover lost events after a connection drop. Even with automatic
reconnections built-in our subscription clients, you are required to manually
refetch the missing events during periods of blackout.

Instead of event streams, Subscriptions can also send object updates made by
other clients. This way the backend has more control over when to send updates,
and how to batch them up without overwhelming the client.

<Alert className="mt-5" severity="info" title="You may not even need this.">
  Before jumping into subscriptions, an application may usually get away with a
  carefully controlled query polling. The correct timing to start considering
  subscriptions is when you try to aggregate a data entity from multiple sources
  and sending updates in a fanout mannar.

## Conclusion

GQty gives you an easy way to work with Subscriptions, but Subscriptions are not
easy to get right.

If you are using managed services like Hasura or Supabase, please by all means
use their Subscriptions because folks at these companies have already done the
hard work for you.
